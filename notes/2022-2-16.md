# To Do's

- [ ] Set up private-react-calendar repo, use this to version control my notes
- [ ] Test a pull request from private to public repo (react-calendar)
- [ ] In account page, changing username should auomatically change default calendar name (ie same as username).
- [ ] In account page, default calendar name should not be editable.
- [ ] Dev tools (react devtools ) should not be found in prod build
- [ ] Reduce webpack output size for prod (check redux dev tools)
